This is my final project for CSC 149: Introduction to Text Mining at Hofstra University. I was tasked with classifying an unlabeled movie into at least one movie genre, with the goal of submitting predictions to the "Predicting Movie Genres from Plot Summaries" competition on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-movie-genres-from-plot-summaries">Kaggle<\a>.
